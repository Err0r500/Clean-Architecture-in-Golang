# Clean Architecture In Golang

>The purpose of this architecture is to be as flexible as possible in order to develop a project as quickly as possible and to maintain this speed during the whole development lifespan, whatever its size and the changes that will have to be done, for whatever reason.

### Detailed explanation of this repo :
[Hands-On Clean Architecture](https://medium.com/@matthieujacquotdev/clean-architecture-in-golang-7ebafe4c70db)


### Demo :
run main_test.go and read the logs to see
- how the execution flows from a layer to another while the dependency inversion rule is strictly observed.
- how an Interface can be substituted to another allowing us to plug IN/OUT dependencies
